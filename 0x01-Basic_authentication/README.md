Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g., a web browser) to provide a username and password when making a request.

When employing Basic Authentication, users include an encoded string in the Authorization header
 of each request they make. The string is used by the request's recipient to verify users' identity and rights to access a resource.
