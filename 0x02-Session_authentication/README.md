Session Authentication

Session Authentication is a form of REST-API authentication that allows the client side and server side interact by use of sessions. An example whereby when the client first makes a request to the server, the server will store the data in a memory known as the session. 

Then when a client again makes a request from the server, the server returns the data and is used as a cookie. The cookie is what will be used by the client and server the next time they will have to interact again.

But now, we have permanent sessions that have a specific timestamp and temporary sessions that are deleted once the client becomes kind-of-like inactive


Explained the session in an easy way for newbies to understand.

Happy Coding!
